2. Estimate the complexity of the move search in different stages of the game.

In the beginning of the game, there are lots of different color combinations for the secret code, which makes things pretty complicated. We can think of this as having lots of options to consider. As the player guesses and gets feedback, things get easier because there are fewer possible combinations left to guess.The complexity can be estimated to be O(n^m), where n is the number of colors and m is the code length. As the game progresses, this complexity reduces as the number of possible combinations decreases.

3. Suggest a system of qubits that describes the game, and define the game states and state vectors.

In a quantum version of the game, each tiny part called a "qubit" could stand for a color in a specific spot of the code. The game's different situations would be like mixtures of these qubits, where each mix shows a potential combination of colors. Imagine if there are 6 colors and the code has 4 spots, we'd have 4 qubits each in a mix of 6 colors. Putting these mixes together, we get the overall situation. 


4. Design quantum gates that implement the operations of the sequential classical algorithm.

Quantum gates act like little rules for how things work in the quantum world. To make them behave like the game, we create special circuits that check if the guessed colors are in the right spots and if they're the right colors. Then, these circuits adjust the quantum situation to match. So, it's like teaching quantum stuff to play the game just like we do.

5. Apply the designed gates to superposition states aiming at parallelization of the move search.

Once we have our quantum rules set up, we use them on the quantum situation representing the current guess. Because of the way quantum stuff works, we can try out lots of guesses at the same time, kind of like doing many things at once. This helps us find the right code faster because we're checking out different options all together. So, it's like speeding up the game by doing lots of moves all at once.
